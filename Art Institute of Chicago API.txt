#INTRODUCTION
TheÿArt Institute of Chicagoÿ(opens new window)'s API provides JSON-formatted data as a REST-style service that allows developers to explore and integrate the museum?s public data into their projects. This API is the same tool that powers ourÿwebsiteÿ(opens new window), ourÿmobile appÿ(opens new window), and many other technologies in the museum.
If the application you're building will be public, please send it our way! We'd love to share it alongside some of theÿother projects that use our APIÿ(opens new window). And if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us:ÿengineering@artic.edu.
#Quick Start
AnÿAPIÿ(opens new window)is a structured way that one software application can talk to another. APIs power much of the software we use today, from the apps on our phones and watches to technology we see in sports and TV shows. We have built an API to let people like you easily get our data in an ongoing way.
TIP
Do you wantÿallÿof our data? Are you running into problems withÿthrottlingÿorÿdeep pagination? Consider using ourÿdata dumpsÿinstead of our API.
For example, you can access theÿ/artworksÿlisting endpoint in our API by visiting the following URL to see all the published artworks in our collection:
https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks
If you want to see data for just one artwork, you can use theÿ/artworks/{id}ÿdetail endpoint. For example, here'sÿStarry Night and the Astronautsÿ(opens new window)by Alma Thomas:
https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/129884
When you view these URLs in your browser, you might see a jumbled bunch of text. That's OK! If you're using Chrome, install theÿJSON Formatter extensionÿ(opens new window), hit reload, and the results will be formatted in a way humans can read, too.
There is a lot of data you'll get for each artwork. If you want to only retrieve a certain set of fields, change theÿfieldsÿparameter in the query to list which ones you want, like this:
https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks?fields=id,title,artist_display,date_display,main_reference_number
TIP
Theÿfieldsÿparameter expects either an array of field names, or a comma-separated list of field names in a single string (e.g. example above). We encourage you to use it because it makes your queries run faster and lets us track which fields need continued support.
You canÿpaginateÿthrough results usingÿpageÿandÿlimitÿparams:
https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks?page=2&limit=100
If you want to search and filter the results, you can do so via our search endpoints. For example, here is aÿfull-text searchÿ(opens new window)for all artworks whose metadata contains some mention of cats:
https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?q=cats
Here is the same search, but filtered to only show artworks that are in the public domain:
https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?q=cats&query[term][is_public_domain]=true
Behind the scenes, our search is powered byÿElasticsearchÿ(opens new window). You can use itsÿQuery DSLÿ(opens new window)to interact with our API. The example above uses aÿtermÿ(opens new window)query. Other queries we use often includeÿexistsÿ(opens new window)andÿboolÿ(opens new window).ÿAggregationsÿ(opens new window)are also a powerful tool.
Our API accepts queries through bothÿGETÿandÿPOST. It might be easier to visualize how theÿGETÿquery above is structured by comparing it to itsÿPOSTÿequivallent:
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "q": "cats",
    "query": {
        "term": {
            "is_public_domain": true
        }
    }
}'
For production use, we recommend usingÿGETÿand passing the entire query as minified URL-encoded JSON via theÿparamsÿparameter. For example:
https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?params=%7B%22q%22%3A%22cats%22%2C%22query%22%3A%7B%22term%22%3A%7B%22is_public_domain%22%3Atrue%7D%7D%7D
WARNING
Our API is flexible in how it accepts queries, but each method of querying is meant for a specific purpose. SeeÿGET vs. POSTÿfor more details.
There's a lot of information you can get about our collection, and there's a lot more than artworks in our API. Explore our documentation to learn more!
#Conventions
* We refer to models in our API as "resources" (e.g.ÿartworks,ÿartists,ÿplaces)
* Resources are typically accessed via their endpoints. Each resource has three endpoints:
o Listing (e.g.ÿ/artworks)
o Detail (e.g.ÿ/artworks/{id})
o Search (e.g.ÿ/artworks/search) (optional)
Some resources might lack a search endpoint if there appears to be no need for it yet.
* Multi-word endpoints are hyphenated (e.g.ÿ/tour-stop).
* All field names are lowercase and snake case (underscore case).
* Every resource in the API hasÿidÿandÿtitleÿfields.
* Fields that contain a single id reference to another resource are singular and end withÿ_id:
* "artist_id": 51349,
* Fields that contain id references to multiple records from another resource are singular and end withÿ_ids:
* "style_ids": ["TM-4439", "TM-8542", "TM-4441"],
* Fields that contain title references to records from other resources follow naming conventions similar to id-based fields:
* "artist_title": "Ancient Roman",
* "classification_titles": ["modern and contemporary art", "painting"],
* Every title-based field has aÿkeywordÿsubfield in Elasticsearch, which is meant for filters and aggregations. See "New defaults" section inÿthis articleÿ(opens new window)for more info.
* Numeric and boolean fields get parsed into actual numbers and booleans:
* "artwork_id": "45", // BAD
* "date_start": 1942, // GOOD
* 
* "is_preferred": "True", // BAD
* "is_in_gallery": true, // GOOD
* We never show any empty strings in the API. We only showÿnull:
* "date_display": "", // BAD
* "artist_display": null, // GOOD
* We prefer to always show all fields, even if they areÿnullÿfor the current record:
o If a field that typically returns a string, number, or object is empty for a given record, we return it asÿnull, rather than omitting it.
o If a field typically returns an array, we prefer to return an empty array, rather than returningÿnull. This is done in part for backwards-compatibility reasons.
#Best Practices
Here are some tips that will make your application run faster and/or reduce load on our systems:
* Cache API responses in your system when possible.
* Use theÿfieldsÿparameter to tell us exactly what fields you need.
* Batch detail queries with the multi-id parameter (?ids=).
* Batch search queries withÿmulti-searchÿ(/msearch).
* Whenÿdownloading images, useÿ/full/843,/0/default.jpgÿparameters.
* When scraping, please use a single thread and self-throttle.
* Consider usingÿdata dumpsÿinstead of scraping our API.
#DATA DUMPS
You can download a dump that contains all of our public data here:
https://github.com/art-institute-of-chicago/api-data(opens new window)
These data dumps are updated nightly. They are generated from our API. As such, they contain the same data as our API, and their schema mirrors that of the API. The data is dumped in JSON format, with one JSON file per record. Records are grouped by API resource type.
Our intention with this approach is to make it easier to adapt code to draw from the data dumps instead of the API, and vice-versa. Since the schema is the same, switching between the two should be relatively straight-forward.
If you notice schema discrepancies between the data dumps and the API, or if you need help with using our data dumps, pleaseÿopen an issueÿ(opens new window)in theÿapi-dataÿrepo.
#Data Dumps vs. API?
We recommend using the data dumps for scenarios such as the following:
* You want to have a full copy of our data for archival purposes.
* You want to scrape a large result set (>10,000 records).
* You want to analyze or enhance our data.
Use our API if the following fits your use case:
* You want to integrate our data into a website or application.
* You need real-time access to our data.
#Scraping Data
Generally, we ask that you avoid extensive scraping of our API. The API is meant for direct integration into websites and applications. The data dumps are meant for backups and analysis. Scraping our API puts undue stress on our systems. Instead of scraping, please download the data dumps and filter them locally to obtain the data you need.
That said, we don't mind small-scale scraping of our API. It can be convenient to use our search endpoint to filter records and retrieve only the fields you need. You can even use theÿaggregationfunctionality of our search endpoints to run some simple analyses. Just remember that you cannot paginate beyond 10,000 results in our search endpoints (seeÿPagination).
If you do decide to scrape our resources, please throttle your requests to no more than one per second and avoid running multiple scrapers in parallel.
#IMAGES
This API does not contain image files. However, it does contain all of the data you need to access our images. Our institution serves images via a separate API that is compliant with theÿIIIF Image API 2.0ÿ(opens new window)specification. Using metadata from this API, you can craft URLs that will allow you to access images of artworks from our collection.
TheÿInternational Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)ÿ(opens new window)stewards a set of open standards that enables rich access to digital media from libraries, archives, museums, and other cultural institutions around the world. In practical terms, they define several API specifications that enable interoperability. When a tool is built to be IIIF-compliant, it's easier to adapt it to consume images from any number of institutions that offer IIIF-compliant APIs.
#IIIF Image API
We deliver our images via theÿIIIF Image API 2.0ÿ(opens new window). Our IIIF URLs have the following structure:
https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/{identifier}/{region}/{size}/{rotation}/{quality}.{format}
We recommend the following URL structure for most use-cases:
https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/{identifier}/full/843,/0/default.jpg
Let's jump right into an example. Here's how you can construct IIIF URLs:
1. Retrieve one or more artworks withÿimage_idÿfields. Here are a few ways of doing so:
2. # La Grande Jatte
3. https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/27992?fields=id,title,image_id
4. 
5. # La Grande Jatte and The Bedroom
6. https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks?ids=27992,28560&fields=id,title,image_id
7. 
8. # Top two public domain artworks
9. https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?query[term][is_public_domain]=true&limit=2&fields=id,title,image_id
Let's go with the first one,ÿLa Grande Jatteÿ(opens new window). Your response will look something like this:
{
    "data": {
        "id": 27992,
        "title": "A Sunday on La Grande Jatte ? 1884",
        "image_id": "1adf2696-8489-499b-cad2-821d7fde4b33"
    },
    "config": {
        "iiif_url": "https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2",
    }
}
10. Find the base IIIF Image API endpoint in theÿconfig.iiif_urlÿfield:
11. https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2
We recommend that you avoid hardcoding this value into your applications.
12. Append theÿimage_idÿof the artwork as a segment to this URL:
13. https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/1adf2696-8489-499b-cad2-821d7fde4b33
14. Appendÿ/full/843,/0/default.jpgÿto the URL:
15. https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/1adf2696-8489-499b-cad2-821d7fde4b33/full/843,/0/default.jpg
That's it! This is a valid IIIF URL. It will return the same image as we use on our website:

Some artworks also haveÿalt_image_ids, such as theÿCoronation Stone of Motecuhzoma IIÿ(opens new window):
https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/75644?fields=id,title,image_id,alt_image_ids
Exhibitions have images, too:
https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/exhibitions/4568?fields=id,title,image_id,alt_image_ids
#Image Sizes
TheÿIIIF Image API 2.0ÿ(opens new window)has a lot of options. However, we prefer to use it conservatively. As mentioned above, here's the URL pattern we use for most projects:
https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/{identifier}/full/843,/0/default.jpg
We recommend usingÿ/full/843,/0/default.jpgÿbecause this is the most common size used by our website, so there's a good chance that the image has previously been requested and cached. If you use this pattern in your projects, it will make images load faster in your application and decrease load on our systems.
TIP
We don't mind if you hotlink to our images. Our images support CORS withÿAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *ÿheaders?same as our API responses! However, please be aware that any image can get unpublished or replaced at any time.
If you'd like to display the full image at smaller sizes, we recommend the following size increments, as these are likely to give you a cache hit as well:
https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/{identifier}/full/200,/0/default.jpg
https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/{identifier}/full/400,/0/default.jpg
https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/{identifier}/full/600,/0/default.jpg
https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/{identifier}/full/843,/0/default.jpg
If you are accessing public domain images, you may also use the following pattern for larger images:
https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/{identifier}/full/1686,/0/default.jpg
However, we still recommend usingÿ843ÿinstead unless there's a clear need forÿ1686.
Why the strange number?843px wide? This number is related to certainÿguidelines for the use of copyrighted materialsÿ(opens new window)within the museum field. Over time, it became the most common dimension used by our applications, so it is the size we continue to recommend.
#IIIF Manifests
We also offer IIIF Manifests for all of our public domain artworks. A manifest is a resource defined by theÿIIIF Presentation APIÿ(opens new window). Each manifest contains artwork metadata?such as title, artist name, and copyright info?alongside a list of images associated with that artwork.
You can access the manifest by appendingÿ/manifest.jsonÿafter the identifier in an artwork detail endpoint. For example, here is the manifest forÿThe Great Waveÿ(opens new window):
https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/24645/manifest.json
These IIIF manifests do not contain any data that cannot be found elsewhere in our API. But because they follow a standardized API, they can be used with IIIF-compliant tools, such asÿMiradorÿ(opens new window). For a fun example, try pasting the URL above into theÿGetty's Animal Crossing Art Generatorÿ(opens new window)?and scroll up to see the result!
#Image Dumps
Unfortunately, we cannot offer image dumps at this time. We are exploring that possibility.
For now, you may scrape images from our IIIF Image API. We ask that you please follow our guidelines forÿscraping imagesÿif you decide to do so.
#Scraping Images
Generally, we prefer that you hotlink to our images, rather than scraping them. Scraping images can put unnecessary strain on our systems. That said, we understand that many use-cases require images to be stored locally.
If you'd like to scrape images from our IIIF API, please follow these guidelines:
* Scrape one image at a time?do not use multiple threads or processes!
* Consider adding a delay of 1 second between each image download
* Use the following URL pattern to download ourÿmost common image size:
* https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/{identifier}/full/843,/0/default.jpg
#Copyright
For information about copyright, please see theÿImage Licensingÿ(opens new window)andÿTermsÿ(opens new window)pages on our website. We defer to those resources in all legal respects.
From a developer's perspective, we recommend only using images from artworks that are tagged as public domain. When querying for artworks, you can filter by public domain status like so:
https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?query[term][is_public_domain]=true&limit=0
To get the full list of artworks that are in the public domain, you will need to download ourÿdata dumpsÿand perform the filtering locally.
Please note that you may encounter images that are not public domain via ourÿIIIF Image API. It is up to you to determine whether or not you are allowed to use these images for your use-case and to obtain any necessary permissions.
#GENERAL INFORMATION
#Authentication
You may access our API without authentication. Anonymous users are throttled to 60 requests per minute. (Each IP counts as a separate user.) If you are working on an application that needs to exceed this restriction, please get in touch with us atÿengineering@artic.edu.
Please useÿHTTPSÿ(opens new window)to access our API. To support legacy applications, our API is currently accessible via both HTTP and HTTPS, but HTTP access will be removed in the future.
Lastly, consider adding aÿAIC-User-Agentÿheader with the name of your project and a contact email to your API requests. For example:
curl 'https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/24645' \
--header 'AIC-User-Agent: aic-bash (engineering@artic.edu)'
We ask that you do so as aÿmatter of courtesyÿ(opens new window). If we see an application using a disproportionate amount of system resources, this gives us an avenue to reach out and work with you to optimize your queries.
TIP
WhyÿAIC-User-Agent? Because modifying theÿUser-Agentÿheader isÿforbidden by some browsersÿ(opens new window). We are using theÿAIC-ÿnamespace to reduce potential conflicts with other applications (RFC 6648ÿ(opens new window)).
#Pagination
Listing and search endpoints are paginated. We show 12 records per page by default. Pagination can be controlled via the following query parameters:
* pageÿto request a specific page of results (1-based, default: 1)
* limitÿto set how many records each page should return (0-based, default: 12)
Example:ÿhttps://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artists?page=2&limit=10(opens new window)
For performance reasons,ÿlimitÿcannot exceed 100. Additionally, you cannot request more than 10,000 records from a single search query through any combination ofÿlimitÿandÿpage. For example:
* Success:ÿhttps://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artists/search?limit=100&page=100(opens new window)
* Error:ÿhttps://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artists/search?limit=100&page=101(opens new window)
Generally, we ask that you avoid scraping our API. If you want to filter and scrape our search results, but the number of results is greater than 10,000, you won't be able to scrape them fully. Instead, we recommend that you download ourÿdata dumpsÿand perform your filtering locally.
Occasionally, it might be useful to check the total number of results without retrieving any data. Our API supports this by allowing you to make a request withÿlimit=0. For example, checkÿpagination.totalÿof this query to see the number of public domain artworks in our API:
https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?query[term][is_public_domain]=true&limit=0(opens new window)
All paginated endpoints include aÿpaginationÿblock in their responses:
{
    "pagination": {
        "total": 112773,
        "limit": 12,
        "offset": 24,  // 0-based
        "current_page": 3, // 1-based
        "total_pages": 9398,
        "prev_url": "https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks?page=2&limit=12",
        "next_url": "https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks?page=4&limit=12"
    },
    "data": [
        // ...
