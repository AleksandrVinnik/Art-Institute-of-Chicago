### üì≤ Processing Steps Breakdown

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Application Launch Phase

- User launches iOS application  
- App sends API request for first page of artworks  
- API returns JSON with metadata and pagination info  
- App parses JSON into `Artwork` model objects  
- Displays artwork titles in list view with pagination status

  <img src="Images/1.%20Application%20Launch%20Phase.PNG" alt="1. Application Launch Phase" width="300"/>
</a>

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Artwork Selection Phase

- User selects specific artwork from list  
- App retrieves image identifier (`imageId`) from model  
- Constructs IIIF URL and requests image  
- IIIF server returns optimized JPEG image data  
- App decodes image data  
- Displays detail view with image, title, and navigation controls

  <img src="Images/2. View Artwork Details - Image and Title.PNG" alt="2. Artwork Selection Phase" width="300"/>
</a>


#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Page Navigation Phase (Dual Mode)

##### **üî¢ Jump to Specific Page**  
- User enters specific page number (N)  
- App validates: `1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ totalPages`  
- **Clears current artworks list**  
- Requests page N from API  
- Receives new set of artworks  
- Parses response into fresh models  
- **Displays only page N content**  
- Updates pagination info  

##### **üîΩ Infinite Scroll (Append Mode)**  
- User scrolls to bottom of list  
- App automatically requests next page (`currentPage + 1`)  
- Receives additional artworks from API  
- **Appends new artworks to existing list**  
- **Maintains all previously loaded content**  
- Updates pagination info  

##### **Key Differences:**  
| Action          | Artwork List Behavior | Page Handling          | UI Update               |
|-----------------|-----------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Jump to Page**| üî¥ Cleared            | Specific page (N)      | Fresh content only      |
| **Scroll Down** | üü¢ Appended           | Next page (current+1)  | Combined content        |

### üîß Key Technical Details

- **Image Optimization:** IIIF protocol delivers exactly sized images (843px width)  
- **Data Caching:** Artwork metadata cached locally after first fetch  
- **Input Validation:** Page numbers validated before API requests  
- **Efficient Rendering:** SwiftUI updates only changed elements in list  
- **Error Handling:** Missing images display fallback text  
- **Responsive UI:** Loading states shown during network operations  

---

### üîç Process Explanation (Overview)

#### Initial Request
The iOS application requests artwork metadata from the Art Institute of Chicago‚Äôs API with a specified page number for paginated results.

#### Metadata Response
The API returns a JSON payload containing:
- Artwork details (ID, title, artist information)  
- Pagination metadata (current page, total pages)  
- Image identifiers (`imageId`) for IIIF image service  

#### Image Retrieval
For each artwork with a valid `imageId`, the app constructs an IIIF-compliant URL and requests the image from the IIIF Image API.

#### Image Delivery
The IIIF service responds with optimized image data, using IIIF's protocol for efficient delivery.

#### Content Rendering
The app combines metadata and images to render:
- Paginated list view with artwork titles  
- Detail view with high-resolution images  
- Navigation controls with real-time pagination status  

---

## üí° Technical Highlights

- **Efficient Data Handling:** Metadata and image requests are decoupled for better performance  
- **Responsive Loading:** Images load asynchronously without blocking the UI  
- **Persistence:** ViewModel retains pagination state across user navigation

## Diagram 2: iOS Application Flow Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[ContentView] -->|Observes| B[ArtworkViewModel]
    B -->|Requests Data| C[Art Institute API]
    C -->|Returns JSON| B
    B -->|Parses Response| D[Artwork Model]
    D -->|Updates View| A
    A -->|User Selects| E[ArtworkDetailView]
    E -->|Requests Image| F[IIIF Image API]
    F -->|Returns Image| E
    E -->|Displays Image| G[AsyncImage]
```

### Architecture Explanation

This diagram illustrates the MVVM architecture implementation:

- **ContentView** observes the `ArtworkViewModel` for state changes  
- **ViewModel** requests data from Art Institute API  
- **API** returns JSON response containing artwork metadata  
- **ViewModel** parses response into `Artwork` model objects  
- Updated models trigger **View** re-rendering  
- User selections navigate to **ArtworkDetailView**  
- Detail view requests images from IIIF Image API  
- Image data is rendered using SwiftUI's `AsyncImage`

## Diagram 3: Detailed Data Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[ArtworkViewModel] -->|Requests| B[Art Institute API]
    B -->|JSON Response| C[ArtworkDataWorkResponse]
    C --> D[Artwork Model]
    D -->|Displays| E[ContentView - List]
    E -->|Selects| F[ArtworkDetailView]
    F -->|Requests| G[IIIF Image API]
    G -->|Image Data| H[AsyncImage View]
```

### Data Flow Explanation

This diagram details the data transformation process:

- `ArtworkViewModel` initiates API requests to `api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks`
- API responds with `ArtworkDataWorkResponse` (wrapper for artwork array + pagination)
- Response is decoded into individual `Artwork` model objects
- Models are displayed in `ContentView`'s List
- User selection triggers navigation to `ArtworkDetailView`
- Detail view constructs IIIF URL using `imageId`
- IIIF Image API delivers optimized image data
- `AsyncImage` View handles loading and rendering
